# Project Title: 
TyCrowe HomeLab Series: FTP Server

## Project Summary:
This Go project starts a basic FTP server that I run on a local home-lab server. 

## Objective:
The objective of this small project is to create an iteratively improved FTP server that I can build into as my needs 
change. Currently, I use this for local video upload to my server from the web-camera at the front door. This tiny 
FTP server runs on a rasp-pi 3 I have setup to communicate with the web-cam at hourly intervals.

### Key Features:
- Basic FTP server
